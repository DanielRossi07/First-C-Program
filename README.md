Download all the files and keep them in the same folder in order to run the program properly.

On the login screen you have 3 username and password alternatives:

Username  Password
Santo     123
Moema     123
Chacara   123

Each username and password is made to a different "store" so, if you use the first login option you have to select the first option on the next screen, and so on.

Example: If you use username: Moema and Password: 123, on the next screen you have to select the option "Unidade - Moema", otherwise your access will be denied.
